# Poke Flut App

## What's Poke Flut App?

Poke Flut is an application specifically designed to carry out the mobile developer recruitment process at the Luna POS. This app is designed by Bijantyum.

## Getting Started

To run this application is very easy, simply by cloning the Github Repository. If it's successful, you can get dependencies first by following these steps:
- Flutter Pub Get
- Melos Bootstrap / Melos bs
- Flutter run

## Architecture Poke FLut App

Using Clean Architecture in software is the right choice, if the developer knows how to implement it. As a Mobile Developer, I always have flexibility and productivity from the development and maintenance period. The time given is only 2 days. Where every time it takes less than 4 hours I work on the project. Therefore I made a modification of the existing Clean Architecture, by eliminating Usecases in the domain layer. For this reason, small-scale applications can be well developed from the results that have been implemented

## Performance

You can run it in Profile mode by running Flutter Run --profile, then see how it performs on each screen. Always under 17ms, this indicates that the application is good enough in terms of performance.

## Testing

I apologize for this, the build_generator on my device is not running since last week. I'm looking for this issue because it interferes with some of my projects. But for reference you can see my page which has testing [See Here](https://github.com/Bintaaaa/ditonton/tree/submission-2)

## Improving

If I have more time there are some things that can be improved, the UI Layer can be separated on each component such as styling, writing more readable code and doing testing. Usually a phase like this will occur, Developers must be ready to do refactoring at any time


## API Issue

From the Fire Pokemon, it was found that things were not flexible, so they needed to improvise. I'm worried that it might annoy the app users because there are too many processes in the code.
